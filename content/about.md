Everything is about Record. History, knowledge, information, power. Or, they are power.

Who controlled the past, controlled the future. And records are the means.

A plethora of words mixed together becomes truth, becomes reality. No one will ponder whether this reality truly occurred.

The circulation of power, the secular forces, human society's identity, ethnicity, nation, history, all of these, in general, are the same. They are the external manifestations of the fundamental power criteria depicted by words, language, and records.

And these, deeply hidden within, influencing the cyclical nature of history time and again, what are the very things represented by the spokespersons of these powers?

When a group of people come together, naturally, they produce kings, courtiers, lackeys, knights, and prostitutes.

Why is this? Because, this is humanity, this is the flock, humans need to be led, and they willingly allow themselves to be led. They incessantly wish to quickly transfer the heavy burden of responsibility and power from themselves to others. When I, addressing the crowd, say, "Follow me, let me bear your burdens!" they gratefully hand over the leadership to me, so that they only need to follow, without facing freedom directly.

Humans fear freedom; freedom is ugly, cruel, not something everyone can love. People willingly accept the bread on the ground because it is delicious, it brings happiness, so they don't have to think about things beyond humanity, beyond the universe, beyond life, future, nothingness.

This is why I should record my opinions, to showcase the truth, brutal freedom, fleeting happiness, the nothingness of life.
